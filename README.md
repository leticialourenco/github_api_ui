The goal of this front-end app is to provide a quick overview of a public GitHub organization, its repos and commits.

## Design decisions

* Easy to use and light UX
* Barebones React for simplicity
* Minimal amount of dependencies on 3rd party libraries to showcase problem-solving abilities

## Run Locally

In the root folder of the application run 
`npm install` followed by `npm start`

## Launch app 

The application is also deployed on **vercel.com** and available online at [github-api-ui.now.sh](https://github-api-ui.now.sh/)

## Current limitations

Due to GitHub REST API limitations, there is no partial search support on the organization name/login. User has to enter full name of an organization, like "netflix", "nasa" or "adobe" in order to find a match. 

## Areas of improvement

* Pagination support
* Deep-linking of the URL for sharing
* Use GraphQL instead of REST to

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
